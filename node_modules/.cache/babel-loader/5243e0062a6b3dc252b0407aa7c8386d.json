situation has changed the landscape for performing arts across the world. \n                            With less freedom to leave our homes, our team found it particularly compelling to explore \n                            how we might be able to transform the physical theater experience into a shared online experience \n                            for the Kelly Strayhorn Theater in Pittsburgh.\n

I focused mainly on how the visual layout \n                            of this online platform could provoke emotions and experiences similar to visiting an actual theater in person.</p>\n                        <TableContainer component={Paper}>\n                            <Table aria-label=\"simple table\">\n                                <TableHead>\n                                <TableRow>\n                                    <TableCell>Team Members</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">Akshaya Madhavan</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">Amy Zhuang</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">Emmett Mack</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">Jenny Ong</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">Victor Grajski</TableCell>\n                                </TableRow>\n                                </TableHead>\n                                <TableBody>\n                                {rows.map((row) => (\n                                    <TableRow key={row.name}>\n                                    <TableCell component=\"th\" scope=\"row\">\n                                        {row.name}\n                                    </TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">{row.pos1}</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">{row.pos2}</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">{row.pos3}</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">{row.pos4}</TableCell>\n                                    <TableCell align=\"right\">{row.pos5}</TableCell>\n                                    </TableRow>\n                                ))}\n                                </TableBody>\n                            </Table>\n                        </TableContainer>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <h5>Problem</h5>\n                    <p>The pandemic has rendered artists unable to make a living, and restricted their access to their audience. \n                        Virtual settings fail to deliver the same quality experience for performing and viewing as a live space would.\n                        How do we transform a physical theater experience into a shared online experience?\n                    </p>\n                <h5>Methods</h5>\n                <p>Background Research - Affinity Diagramming - Speed Dating with Storyboarding - Experience Prototyping</p>\n                <h5>Evidence (Quotes)</h5>\n                <p>In person, I always went to shows in groups. Virtually, only one thing was with another person. Everything else was \n                    alone. It wasn’t the same. We were on facetime while we were watching. We had to mute each other. It didn’t work that \n                    well.\n                    <br/><br/>\n                    At the theater, there is an energy you’re sharing with performers and the other audience members, no way to duplicate \n                    that with the remote format\n                </p>\n                <h5>Insights</h5>\n                <p>We learned that current streaming platforms limit the online theater experience because they remove \n                    the unique associations of attending a real theater, such as the grand atmosphere, the presence of t\n                    he actors, and a collective audience experience.</p>\n                <p>We also found that many artists and audience members feel less connected online. Artists want to feel \n                    like their audience is present during the performance, barring extreme distractions. Audience members \n                    want to feel that they are in the presence of a larger group, but they also want to have more nuanced \n                    interactions with small groups of friends or family. </p>\n                <h5>Solution</h5>\n                <p>This includes customizable viewing options, such as private watch party rooms for audience groups that allow \n                    for a more intimate way to experience performances, and real-time audience and artist interactions. On the \n                    artist side, Showscape features highly customizable performance set-up options that allow artists to fully \n                    control how their content is presented. Audiences can show their support for artists with reactions or through\n                    donations and buying a virtual rose. These features all help bring artists and audiences closer together and \n                    back into a more familiar context. Through our platform, we believe users can enjoy the theater experience at \n                    home.</p>\n                <h5>Next Steps</h5>\n                <p>Integrating more lo-fi functionalities that are inspired from physical theater-going in a creative way online. \n                    For example how could vendors, pamphlets, autographs, and panels be incorporated into our prototype? \n                    <br/><br/>\n                    Ultimately, it would be nice to create a working version of our prototype for the Kelly Strayhorn Theater. \n                </p>\n            </div>\n    );\n  };\n  \n  export default ProjectsInfo;\n\n        /*\n        The portfolio page should frame and scope the problem, include selective evidence to convince the audience of \n        the importance of the problem and the insights leading towards the solution, use descriptions of methods to \n        support the validity of the evidence provided, and extract key insights and takeaways both along the way as \n        well as overall for the project to provide a compelling and persuasive account of the project findings.\n        */"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
